# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## AI Assistant Instructions

**For detailed guidance on this project, please read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).**

The AGENTS.md file contains comprehensive documentation about:
- Repository overview and architecture
- Project structure and key files
- Development commands and workflows
- Common tasks and debugging tips
- Code style and best practices
- Build and release process

This separation allows the same detailed instructions to be used by multiple AI assistants and tools, while CLAUDE.md serves as the standard entry point for Claude Code specifically.
